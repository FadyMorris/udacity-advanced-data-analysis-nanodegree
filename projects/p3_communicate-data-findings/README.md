# Communicate Data Findings Project
## Ford GoBike System Data
>  By Fady Morris Ebeid

### Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made
in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco
Bay area for February 2019. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv).  
Other years data can be obtained from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html).

#### data files contains these key columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
- Member Birth Year
- Member Gender (Male or Female)
- Bike Share For All Trip (tracks members who are enrolled in the Bike Share for All program for low-income residents).


### Summary of Findings

In this exploration I am interested in trip duration and frequency as they are related to company's revenue. I investigated the key factors that affected them.  
According to analysis I found that on average customers trips are longer than subscribers (almost double). Subscribers tend to favor work weekdays over weekends for using bikes. Around 75% of users are between 20 and 40 years old and popular hours for bike usage were between 8-9 am and 17-18 pm.

### Key Insights for Presentation

In the presentation I summarized my key findings, displaying key univariate and bivariate plots. In univariate plots, I presented the frequency of trips on weekdays, day hours, age groups, gender and customer type. Then I moved to key bivariate plots that display the relationship between user type and duration and user type trends during weekdays.
